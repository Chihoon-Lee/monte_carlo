# monte_carlo

In this repository, we will be using the Monte Carlo Method to determine the approximate values for the area of a circle, volume of a sphere, circumference of a circle, and surfacea area of a sphere. The Monte Carlo Method uses repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, and can be used to estimate the value of pi. Using Python, we can generate random points inside of a 2x2 square. Inside of the 2x2 square, there is also an inscribed circle of radius 1. After counting the number of points inside of the circle, we can find the ratio of the number of points inside of the circle and the number of points in total to find an estimated value of pi (the area of a unit circle). We can also use similar methods to find the volume of a sphere, the circumference of a circle, and the surface area of a sphere. For a very large number of randomly generated points (1,000,000+), the Monte Carlo Method will provide an accurate estimate of these results - the more points there are, the more accurate the estimate will be. This method works well since we don't need a graph or visuals to display the points, but only need the x and y values to determine whether or not the points is in the circle.
